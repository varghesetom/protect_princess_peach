# Protect Princess Peach 

Small game built with PyGame where Mario has to chase the koopas aiming to capture Princess Peach as she collects flowers. 
Move around with the keypad to tag as many koopas as possible 

## Installation 

Developed with Python 3.6 on a MacOS with Pygame 1.9.6. Installing pygame and dependencies can be problematic depending on the system. I recommend trying to use brew install pygame, sdl, sdl_image, sdl_mixer, sdl_ttf, smpeg portmidi 
or going to their website depending on your architecture https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
